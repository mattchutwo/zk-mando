# zk-Mando (aka. BoutyGuardian Program - ZK Bug Bounty Program)
BountyGuardian protocol utilizes a novel proof compiler 'CHEESECLOTH' that verifies the authenticity of vulnerabilities, and integrates it with smart contracts developed into a zero knowledge decentralized application complemented by a white hat reputation system. We aim to enhance incentives for exploit resolution through token rewards and stake deposits from vendors, alongside an on-chain reputation system that allows participants to build their credibility as they engage in bug bounty programs. By cryptographically proving their knowledge of specific software vulnerabilities without revealing the actual exploit itself, white hats can enhance their trustworthiness. This system ensures that while other verifiers on the chain verify the proof, they remain unaware of the exploit details, thus guarded the vendor's privacy and system security.


The main contributions of BountyGuardian protocol are shown as: 
1. Merkle tree-based on-chain reputation system which authenticates the reputation of users at the same time facilitates an early-staged credit based blockchain ecosystem. 

2. Smart contract-driven incentive mechanism which encourages timely and fair responses from vendors to reported vulnerabilities, using Bug Bounty tokens. 

3. ZK submission and verification processes which allows hackers to submit vulnerabilities anonymously yet verifiably using ZK proofs, meanwhile provide the opportunities to review vulnerabilities on transparent logs after a predetermined time frame.
